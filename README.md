# MGS Capital SA Financial Modeling Notebook

## Overview
Welcome to the MGS Capital SA Financial Modeling Notebook repository. This project is designed to guide users through the strategic and optimized allocation of a 100 million CHF fund. It is important to note that MGS Capital SA is a fictional name, and this project serves educational purposes, primarily as part of a university curriculum.


## Introduction
This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook that facilitates a quantitative approach to portfolio management. The primary objective is to achieve a balanced and high-performing portfolio through meticulous fund allocation.

## Financial Models
The project utilizes two main financial models:
1. **Black-Litterman Model**: Integrates our market views with the equilibrium market views for optimal asset allocation.
2. **Risk Parity Allocation**: Focuses on allocating funds based on the risk contribution of each asset.

## Benchmarking
The fundâ€™s performance is benchmarked against the **Russell 50 Mega-Cap Index**, which comprises the 50 largest companies in the U.S.

- ### Refer to the `BL-RiskParity-BackTesting` Python Notebook inside the *BL-RiskParity-BackTesting* folder for the detailed code and workflow.
